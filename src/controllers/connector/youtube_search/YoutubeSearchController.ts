   * Get YouTube video search results
   *
   * The search results have the video title and link.
   *
   * If most users are going to use this feature, they probably want to watch the video, so it's better to provide a URL.
   *
   * In order to filter the period that the user wants, you should use the response field "published_date".
   *
   * For example, if the user wants to retrieve only this year's videos, you should exclude videos that were uploaded in a period that the user does not want, such as "1 year ago" or "2 years ago" with a published_date.
   *
   * It's great to use with the /transcript endpoint when summarizing videos, analyzing content, extracting keywords, etc.
   *
   * Extract the URL from the YouTube video information obtained from the execution result of the corresponding function and use it as the input of the /transcript endpoint.
   *
   * Based on the transcripts obtained from the execution result of the /transcript endpoint, perform tasks such as summarizing videos, analyzing content, and extracting keywords.
   *
   * Example Use Cases:
   * Product Reviews: Extract product names, pros, cons, and recommendations from air purifier review videos.
   * Tutorials: Create text-based tutorials or step-by-step guides from instructional videos.
   *
   * @summary YouTube video search
