   * Search for a list of couriers matching the invoice number
   *
   * A courier code is essential to search for an invoice.
   * Therefore, if a user knows the invoice number but does not know which courier will deliver his or her parcel, he or she cannot search for the invoice.
   * To solve this problem, this connector provides a function that infers the courier matching the invoice number.
   * However, even if this function is called, multiple couriers that may be couriers may appear, so it is impossible to know which company will transport this parcel.
   *
   * Of course, if there is only one target in the list, the probability that it will be that courier is almost 100%.
   *
   * @summary Search for a list of couriers matching the invoice number
   * @returns List of couriers
   * @param input Conditions for courier search

   * To search for an invoice, you need the courier code in addition to the invoice number you want to search for.
   * If you know which courier will transport your package, you can search for the courier and get the courier code from the courier whose name matches the courier code.
   * If you know the invoice number but do not know the courier code, you can use 'Search for a list of couriers matching the invoice number' to infer the courier that will transport your package.
   * When you search for a package, you can find out the current location and time of the package, as well as who is transporting the package.
   * In some cases, there may be a phone number, but it is not absolute.
   * In addition, in cases where the product is delivered directly by an commerce company such as Coupang, there are cases where you cannot search even if you have the invoice number.
