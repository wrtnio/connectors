   * For example, if you are fetch tweets from multiple users and have a summary request, you must use the results from only one request to summarize the tweets for each user.

   * You must use the /summarize endpoint to proceed with the summary after fetching the tweet, do not allow this endpoint to be used just for summarization.

   * You must assume that the results may contain irrelevant tweets against the query. You must filter the results based on the query. Do your best to cherry-pick the relevant tweets only.
