/**
 * Order completion and payment information.
 *
 * `IShoppingOrderPublish` is an entity that embodies the series of processes
 * in which a {@link IShoppingCustomer customer} pays for his or her
 * {@link IShoppingOrder order}, thereby completing the order. And only after
 * the order is {@link paid_at completed}, can the {@link IShoppingSeller seller}
 * recognize that the customer has purchased his product.
 *
 * By the way, please note that just because the `IShoppingOrderPublish` record
 * exists, it does not mean that the payment has been completed. Of course, with
 * "credit cards" and "Google Pay", payment application and payment occur at the
 * same time. However, there are some cases where payment is made after the
 * payment application, such as "bank transfer" or "virtual account payment".
 * Therefore, to see the completion of payment, be sure to check the
 * {@link paid_at} property.
 *
 * In addition, even after payment has been made, there may be cases where it is
 * suddenly cancelled, so please be aware of this as well.
