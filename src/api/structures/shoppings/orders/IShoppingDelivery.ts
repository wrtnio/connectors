/**
 * Delivery information.
 *
 * When delivering {@link IShoppingOrderGood goods} to
 * {@link IShoppingCustomer customer}, {@link IShoppingSeller seller} can deliver
 * multiple {@link IShoppingSaleUnitStock stocks}, goods at once. Also, it is
 * possible to deliver a stock or good in multiple times due to physical restriction
 * like volume or weight problem.
 *
 * As you can see from above, the relationship between delivery with
 * {@link IShoppingOrder order} (or {@link IShoppingOrderGood good}) is not 1: 1 or
 * N: 1, but M: N. Entity `IShoppingDelivery` has been designed to represent such
 * relationship, by referencing target stocks or goods through subsidiary entity
 * {@link IShoppingDeliveryPiece}.
 *
 * Also, delivery does not end with only one step. It has multiple processes like
 * manufacturing, planning, shipping and delivering. Those steps are represented by
 * another subsidiary entity {@link IShoppingDeliveryJourney}.
