 * still at the "order application" stage and not the "order confirmation" stage.
 *
 * And as soon as a customer applies for an order, all
 * {@link IShoppingCartCommodity commodities} in the target shopping cart are
 * promoted to {@link IShoppingOrderGood goods}, and those good records are created
 * under this `IShoppingOrder`.
 *
 * Of course, not all commodities in the target shopping cart become
 * {@link IShoppingOrderGood}, but only those selected by the customer become the
 * {@link IShoppingOrderGood}.
