Best by: 01/2027 Best by The length of time for \"Best By\" date depends on the type of product, as well as the brand.Perishable items (such as flax oils or certain probiotics) generally have shorter \"Best By\" dates. Although our warehouse is fully air-conditioned, these more fragile items are put in cold storage (freezer or refrigeration unit) for maximum freshness.Our receiving department does its best to verify and then enter the correct \"Best By\" dates for all incoming products. However, discrepancies do occur from time to time. This being said, the exceptionally high turnover at iHerb ensures that our inventory is among the freshest in the industry. First available: 02/2016 Shipping weight: 0.18 kg Shipping weight The Shipping Weight includes the product, protective packaging material and the actual shipping box. In addition, the Shipping Weight may be adjusted for the Dimensional Weight (e.g. length, width & height) of a package. It is important to note that certain types of products (e.g. glass containers, liquids, fragile, refrigerated or ice packed) will often require protective packaging material. As such, these products will reflect a higher Shipping Weight compared to the unprotected product.

No other brand has seemed to work as effectively with my body. When I take it daily it helps me maintain a good immune system (as in I don't catch a cold) but if ever I slack off and I feel I'm about to go under this always ends up coming to the rescue!Disclaimer:Not medical or professional advice.00Report abuseiHerbCustomerUnited States430013Posted on Feb 6, 2024Good ProductVerified purchaseRewarded reviewThis vitamin C was purchased to help make my free shipping. I felt it was a little overpriced. This company makes decent products overall, and I always appreciate fewer fillers. We use C for iron carriage as well as immune system building.
