They are stored and shipped directly from our climate-controlled, GMP-certified warehouses. iHerb does not allow 3rd-party resellers on its web site or mobile apps. Best by: 01/2027 Best by The length of time for \"Best By\" date depends on the type of product, as well as the brand.Perishable items (such as flax oils or certain probiotics) generally have shorter \"Best By\" dates. Although our warehouse is fully air-conditioned, these more fragile items are put in cold storage (freezer or refrigeration unit) for maximum freshness.Our receiving department does its best to verify and then enter the correct \"Best By\" dates for all incoming products. However, discrepancies do occur from time to time. This being said, the exceptionally high turnover at iHerb ensures that our inventory is among the freshest in the industry. First available: 02/2016 Shipping weight: 0.18 kg Shipping weight The Shipping Weight includes the product, protective packaging material and the actual shipping box. In addition, the Shipping Weight may be adjusted for the Dimensional Weight (e.g. length, width & height) of a package. It is important to note that certain types of products (e.g. glass containers, liquids, fragile, refrigerated or ice packed) will often require protective packaging material. As such, these products will reflect a higher Shipping Weight compared to the unprotected product.
